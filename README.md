👤🚀 Day 27 of My JavaScript Journey: Real-Time User Profiles with Filter Functionality!

Today, I took a step further in user interaction, crafting a Live User Profile Page with a powerful filtering feature. Here's what I accomplished:

🔄 Real-Time Updates: I implemented real-time updates to the user profiles, ensuring that changes are reflected instantly.

🔍 Filter Functionality: I added a dynamic filter, allowing users to tailor their viewing experience by sorting profiles based on specific criteria.
